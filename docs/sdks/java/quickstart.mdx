For Android projects, the installation is a bit different for restrictions in the JNA library for Java, that has an specific version (aar) to work on Android devices.

<CodeBlock language="groovy">
  {`implementation 'net.java.dev.jna:jna:5.12.1@aar'
implementation('com.bloock.sdk:bloock-sdk:SDK_VERSION') { 
  exclude group: "net.java.dev.jna", module: "jna" 
}`}

## Set up

To start working with most of the functionalities of our SDKs, you will need an API Key. Please, follow the instructions of [Create an API Key](../../guides/platform/create-api-key) to get one.

Here's the code needed to properly configure the SDK Client with the API Key:

import SetupJava from '!!raw-loader!@site/examples/setup/setup/Setup.java';

<CodeBlock language="java">{SetupJava}</CodeBlock>
