BLOOCK provides an open-source and configurable website called ValidProof, built in React, which allows you to verify records. This platform offers a carefully curated user experience that enables you to visualize all verification steps and validation details.

ValidProof empowers you to independently verify data recorded on the blockchain, validate digital signatures, ensure document availability in distributed systems, and add access control to these verifications. It allows comprehensive or modular integrity, authenticity, privacy, and availability file validation.

Organizations can deploy their version of this website to implement it in their services and, customize the look and feel to match their brand image through simple configurations.
