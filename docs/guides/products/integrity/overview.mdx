This section provides all the information needed to understand and integrate with BLOOCK's data certification service based on permissionless blockchains.

# Certification flow

In order to certify some data with BLOOCK, there are some steps that are happening, some of them need to be implemented by you (using our SDKs) and others are done by BLOOCK itself.

As a summary, you will need to implement only two parts:

1. Prepare data
2. Send data
3. Synchronization
