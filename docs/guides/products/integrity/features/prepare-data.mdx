# Prepare data

The first step of the certification process is to prepare the data that you want to certify through BLOOCK.

This basically translates to load this data to the SDK, standardize it and compute a hash using the algorithm that BLOOCK uses internally (Keccak256). Luckily, all this process is done by the SDK internally so all you need to do is&#x20;

## The Record entity

The principal element of the BLOOCK SDKs is the Record as it's used on most of the functionalities. It's responsible for different interactions such as:

- Encapsulate your data
- Hashing
- Add [digital signatures](broken-reference)
- Add [encryption](broken-reference)
- Add self-contained metadata

### Record builders

In order to generate a Record, our SDKs provide different builders to do so. Those builders enable to set as input different data types, formats or encodings based on your needs.

#### Available builders

Currently, the following builders are available:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="256">Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>fromString</td>
      <td>It takes a UTF-8 string as input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fromBytes</td>
      <td>It takes an array of bytes as input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fromHex</td>
      <td>
        It takes a hash string (hex encoded 64-chars long string) as input
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fromJson</td>
      <td>It takes a JSON as input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fromRecord</td>
      <td>It takes a record as input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fromFile</td>
      <td>It takes a file (as a byte array) as input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fromLoader</td>
      <td>
        It takes a Loader as input (for more information check{' '}
        <a data-mention href="broken-reference">
          Broken link
        </a>
        )
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
