# The integrity proof entity

Once a data submitted to BLOOCK for certification gets included in an anchor, you are able to retrieve an integrity proof for it.
This proof is computed as an optimized Merkle proof by BLOOCK representing the minimal necessary data to mathematically prove that a record was included at a certain point in time to the blockchain. The computed proof has the following properties:
Timeless, meaning that, once retrieved, those can be verified at any time in the future.

- Proofs can be retrieved for multiple records which enables to verify the existence of a set of records at once.
- Proofs are auto verifiable by the user without the intervention of BLOOCK.

:::tip
It's important to note that BLOOCK is not able to emit fraudulent proofs because of the cryptographic properties of the Merkle trees.

When you retrieve an integrity proof for one or more data to be able to further verify them, you will receive a set of data consisting of:

| Field  | Description                                                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Leaves | An array of hashes that contains exactly the input data to get the integrity proof from.               |
| Nodes  | An array of hashes that will be combined with the leaves to run the Merkle proof verification process. |
| Bitmap | Hexadecimal value used to combine the leaves and nodes in order to correctly compute the proof.        |
| Depth  | Additional information needed to run the verification process.                                         |
| Root   | The anchor root that the integrity proof should resolve to when verified.                              |
| Anchor | Contains information related to the anchor from which the integrity proof was computed from.           |
