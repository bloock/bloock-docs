# The Record entity

The principal element of the BLOOCK SDKs is the Record as it's used on most of the functionalities. It's responsible for different interactions such as:

- Encapsulate your data
- Hashing
- Add [digital signatures](./../../key/overview.mdx#what-digital-signature)
- Add [encryption](./../../key/concepts/operations.mdx#operations)
- Add self-contained metadata

### Record builders

In order to generate a Record, our SDKs provide different builders to do so. Those builders enable to set as input different data types, formats or encodings based on your needs.

#### Available builders

Currently, the following builders are available:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="256">Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>fromString</td>
      <td>It takes a UTF-8 string as input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fromBytes</td>
      <td>It takes an array of bytes as input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fromHex</td>
      <td>
        It takes a hash string (hex encoded 64-chars long string) as input
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fromJson</td>
      <td>It takes a JSON as input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fromRecord</td>
      <td>It takes a record as input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fromFile</td>
      <td>It takes a file (as a byte array) as input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>fromLoader</td>
      <td>It takes a Loader as input</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
