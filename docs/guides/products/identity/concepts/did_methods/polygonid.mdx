# did:polygonid {#did:polygonid}

The method id called `did:polygonid` has the following characteristics.
- It's derived from a [Baby JubJub key](https://docs.iden3.io/publications/pdfs/Baby-Jubjub.pdf) and other cryptographic material. This key can be created with [BLOOCK Keys product](go_to_baby_jub_jub_keys_documentation) in a managed way or by yourself locally. It will be very important to be able to control your identity.
- [Here](https://github.com/iden3/go-iden3-crypto/tree/master/babyjub) you will find more technical information about the key creation.

- Example:
