Next, we must think about what type of credentials we want to issue. For example, we want to issue a card that identifies BLOOCK employees. In order to create the schema I have to follow these steps.

1. I must first think about the name of the schema type, in this case for example it would be BloockEmployee.
2. I must define what attributes my credential will have, for example, I will put an employee number, name and date of birth.

Once this is defined, I will be able to create my schema. Notice that all we are doing is defining the attributes that our credentials will have.

[The schemas](#schemas) are uploaded to IPFS, in order to identify the schemas we use their IPFS identifier.
