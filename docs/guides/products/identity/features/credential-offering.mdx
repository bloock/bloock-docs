The credential offering process refers to the transfer of the Verifiable Credential (VC) to the assigned user or Holder. 
It requires two agents (Issuer and Holder) and a [wallet or software](#what-is-a-wallet) where the credential will be stored. 
At the Holder level, this is done by scanning a QR code generated by the Issuer from the Holder's wallet. 
At the protocol level this communication is highly secure thanks to the [DIDComm protocol](#dIDComm-messaging) used and the authentication and identity proofs mechanisms.
