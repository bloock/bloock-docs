Finally, Issuer may decide to revoke or invalidate any credential. Therefore, you will have to execute the [revocation](#revocation) process.
Having a credential revoked what it means is that the Holder will not be able to generate any [proof](#proofs).
When you revoke a credential what we are doing is generate a new [Sparse Merkle Tree Proof](#proof) of revocation. Therefore, we need the [Issuer's state](#state-transition) to be processed once the revocation action is executed. And obviously this state transition will be marked by the [interval](#issuer-intervals) we have set. **It is important to note that the effect of the revocation will not be visible until this Issuer state transition is executed**.
