# Supported algorithms

BLOOCK supports different type of encryption algorithms so you can choose the one that better fits your requirements. Currently, we support the two most common types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric.

## Symmetric encryption

Symmetric encryption is an encryption type where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt some data. This requires that both entities (the encrypter and the decrypter) exchange this key so it can be used in the decryption process.

The specific algorithms that we support for symmetric encryption are:

- **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **RSA** (_Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)_

## Asymmetric encryption

Asymmetric encryption is an encryption type where a key pair (public key + private key) is used to encrypt and decrypt data in a way that data encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the private key.

The specific algorithms that we support for asymmetric encryption are:

- **ECIES** (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme)
