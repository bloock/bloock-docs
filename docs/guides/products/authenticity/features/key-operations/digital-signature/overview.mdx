# Overview

Authenticity is meant to validate the source or origin of data and other file transfers. It's the assurance that a message, transaction, or other exchange of information is from the source it claims to be from. This is important because it ensures that the record has not been forged or corrupted during transmission.&#x20;

This section provides all the information needed to understand and integrate with BLOOCK's digital signature tooling.

## What's a digital signature?

A digital signature—a type of electronic signature—is a mathematical algorithm routinely used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message (e.g., an email, a credit card transaction, or a digital document). Digital signatures create a virtual fingerprint that is unique to a person or entity and are used to identify users and protect information in digital messages or documents. In emails, the email content itself becomes part of the digital signature. Digital signatures are significantly more secure than other forms of electronic signatures.

## Process

Step 1 is **preparation**.&#x20;

You create a huge random number: the private key. You can use this to create digital signatures. You then create the public key, which is used to verify the signatures the private key creates. The public key is calculated from the private key. You hand the public key to Fred in person so Fred is sure it belongs to you.

Step 2 is **signing**.&#x20;

You write an email to Fred and attach the cat picture. You also use your private key and the cat picture to digitally sign the cat picture. The result is a digital signature that you include in your email message. You then send the email to Fred.

Step 3 is **verifying**.&#x20;

Fred receives your email, but he’s concerned the cat picture might be corrupt, so he wants to verify the signature. He uses the public key he got from you in step 1, the digital signature in the email, and the attached cat picture. If the signature or the cat picture has changed since you created the signature, the verification will fail.
