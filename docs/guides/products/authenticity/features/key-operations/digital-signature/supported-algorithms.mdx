# Supported algorithms

BLOOCK currently supports different digital signature methods. You can choose the one it better accomplishes your requirements.

| Method                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------- |
| Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) |
| Ethereum Name Service (ENS)                        |

## ECDSA

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm or ECDSA is a digital signature algorithm (DSA) that uses elliptic-curve cryptography.

It works by initially generating a key pair (public key + private key) which will be used for signing and further verification. Specifically, the private key is used to generate the signature and the public key is used for the verification process.

It's important that you never disclose your private key. You must keep it safe on your system or you can use a managed software such as a Vault or a HSM to keep it secure for you.

## ENS

Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.

It's used as a blockchain-based DNS in a way that you are able to acquire (.eth) domains and assign it to an Ethereum public key (extracted from the secp256k1 elliptic curve).

Applied in an authenticity context, BLOOCK allows you to sign some data/document using your Ethereum's private key and extract your (.eth) domain as a result of the verification process.
