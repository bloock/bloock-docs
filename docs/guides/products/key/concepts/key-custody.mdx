# Key custody

In BLOOCK, you can create any key using different custody modes:

- **Local mode**: The local mode consists of creating a [key](../about-keys#key-types) where the user stores it's private information.
- **Management mode**: The managed mode consists of creating a [key](../about-keys#key-types) secured by the BLOOCK service using a FIPS 140-2 Level 1 certified software-protected infrastructure.

:::tip
In any case we do not have the private key, your key will be stored in a software-protected service that complies with the security level of FIPS 140-2 Level 1 certified.
