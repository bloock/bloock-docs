# Management modes {#management-modes}

In BLOOCK you can create any object using different management modes:

- **Local mode**: The local mode consists of creating an [object](./objects.mdx#object-types) where the user stores his private information. For example, in the case of the [keys object](./../overview.mdx#what-cryptographic-key), the user keeps the private key and in no case will connect to BLOOCK services.
- **Management mode**: The managed mode consists of creating an [object](./objects.mdx#object-types) guarded by the BLOOCK service, a FIPS 140-2 Level 1 certified software-protected vault. For example, in the case of a [key object](./../overview.mdx#what-certificate), the user does not have to worry about the private key.

| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key Generation | Users generate and store their own keys  | Keys are generated and managed by BLOOCK\*               |
| Storage        | Keys stored locally on the device        | Keys stored centrally by BLOOCK                          |
| Scalability    | Limited scalability due to local storage | Greater scalability due to centralized storage by BLOOCK |
| Security       | Depends on user's security practices     | Enhanced security as managed by BLOOCK                   |
| Management     | Users are responsible for key management | BLOOCK handles key management                            |

\* In any case we do not have the private key, your key will be stored in a software-protected service that complies with the security level of FIPS 140-2 Level 1 certified.
