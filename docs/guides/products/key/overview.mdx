# Overview {#overview}

Authenticity is meant to validate the source or origin of data and other file transfers. It's the assurance that a message, transaction, or other exchange of information is from the source it claims to be from. This is important because it ensures that the record has not been forged or corrupted during transmission.

This section provides all the information needed to understand and integrate with BLOOCK's digital signature tooling.

### What's a digital signature?

A digital signature —a type of electronic signature— is a mathematical algorithm routinely used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message (e.g., an email, a credit card transaction, or a digital document). Digital signatures create a virtual fingerprint that is unique to a person or entity and are used to identify users and protect information in digital messages or documents. In emails, the email content itself becomes part of the digital signature. Digital signatures are significantly more secure than other forms of electronic signatures.
