# Supported methods

BLOOCK supports different type of data availability methods so you can choose the one that better fits your requirements.

## Hosted (Cloud)

It allows you to upload data and documents to a centralized and compliant storage solution, typically known as hosting. Our solution implements a high availability, low latency and private platform to manage all your data and documents.

We use Microsoft Azure as Storage Cloud provider with all data stored in West Europe (Amsterdam), complying with all data related European regulations.

## Distributed (IPFS)

InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. It is a peer-to-peer (P2P) storage network where content is accessible through peers located anywhere in the world.

BLOOCK provides access to this system by acting as a gateway for easy access and as indexer by pinning all data uploaded to our platform.

## What is the difference?

Centralized and decentralized data availability refer to two different approaches for managing and accessing data.

In a centralized system, all data is stored in a central location or database. Access to the data is controlled and managed by a central authority or entity, typically a server or a group of servers. This central authority is responsible for ensuring that the data is available to authorized users while protecting it from unauthorized access or modification. Centralized systems typically rely on a single point of failure, meaning that if the central authority fails, the entire system may become unavailable.

On the other hand, in a decentralized system, data is distributed across multiple nodes or computers, and access to the data is managed by a network of participants, rather than a central authority. Decentralized systems provide redundancy and fault tolerance since there is no single point of failure. If one node fails or becomes unavailable, other nodes can continue to provide access to the data.

In terms of data availability, centralized systems may be more vulnerable to disruption since they rely on a single point of control. If the central authority fails or is compromised, data availability may be impacted. Decentralized systems, on the other hand, may provide more robust data availability since the data is distributed across multiple nodes, and access is managed by a network of participants. If one node becomes unavailable, other nodes can continue to provide access to the data.

Overall, both centralized and decentralized systems have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which system to use will depend on various factors, such as the type of data being stored, the level of security required, and the needs of the organization.
