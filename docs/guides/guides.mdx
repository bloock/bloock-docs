We are a cloud service that guarantees **data integrity and authenticity** in a simple, scalable and confidential manner **on top of distributed ledger technologies**.&#x20;

BLOOCK's goal is to provide you with quick access to decentralized technologies. By this, we ensure that your in-house team with less prior experience in the area can integrate its projects and solutions easily with blockchain. This also helps in bypassing the principal risks and difficulties faced when defining, developing and managing a blockchain project.

## **Value proposition**

### **Easy to use**

BLOOCK enables simple and flexible integrations eliminating all needless complexity for you to get up and running in the blink of an eye.

Why:

- Blockchain technology can bring about 80% business process change and 20% technology implementation. This drastically changes your current framework: its implementation could mean an entire rebuild of the already established legacy structure.
- The need of a simple blockchain solution is urgent as the technology is lacking a universal standard.
- There is a lack of adequate skill set in the developer's market while the demand for blockchain talent has increased by over 300%.

BLOOCK offers multilanguage libraries designed with developers in mind ranging from base cryptography such as encryption and digital signature to decentralized protocols integration, reducing drastically its learning curve.

### Highly Scalable <a href="#highly-scalable" id="highly-scalable"></a>

BLOOCK increases decentralized ledger technologies throughput for any at scale project to grow on demand without a hassle.

Why:

- Although operationally viable blockchain solutions are mature, scalable solutions for widespread adoption are not feasible.
- Billions of dollars had been sunk but hardly any use cases made technological sense or could be delivered at scale.
- Ethereum has a throughput of 14 transactions per second shared between all participants and Bitcoin 5 tps.

BLOOCK aggregates all records in a package and sends it as a single transaction to distributed ledger protocols increasing its scalability up to 4000 records per second per customer

### Privacy by default <a href="#no-needless-complexity" id="no-needless-complexity"></a>

BLOOCK grants you the highest privacy standards and GDPR regulatory compliance for you to be protected at any time.

Why:

- Currently privacy poisoning impacts 70% of all organizations due to the raw data publication on decentralized ledger technologies.
- GDPR is based on the assumption that there’s one entity in charge of each data point, a ‘data controller’. Blockchains replace this unitary actor with many different players by definition, causing legal uncertainty.&#x20;
- Permissionless blockchains confront the international data transfers restriction of the GDPR if not properly designed.

BLOOCK applies encryption prior sending to its cloud services, which are hosted in the EU. By thus, BLOOCK acts as the ’data controller’ and offers mechanisms to cover all GDPR conditions such as ‘right to be forgotten’, ‘accountability’, etc.

### Cost effectiveness

BLOOCK dramatically reduces development, maintenance and on-going costs whilst also minimizing your time to market.

Why:

- According to median salaries, blockchain engineers salaries double traditional software engineer ones.
- Due to high budgets, maintenance and recurring costs, 70% of already developed enterprise level blockchain projects lack a clear return on investment.
- Transaction fees for highly used network has increased severely reaching a median of $17.37 per data record.

BLOOCK can be integrated by non-specialized software developers thanks to its multilanguage libraries, and its services include infrastructure maintenance. Transaction costs are reduced due to collateralizing them among all messages included in each package.

### Cost predicatbility

BLOOCK offers a stable cost per record that can be paid in FIAT for you to plan out your budget in advance and avoid cryptocurrencies' regulation discomfort.

Why:

- Cryptocurrencies prices are unpredictable facing fluctuations of up to 30% in a single day.&#x20;
- Transaction costs are based on network usage, which is also a moving factor that highly influences its cost.
- Cryptocurrency regulations are immature and constantly evolving being the main discomfort source faced by enterprises when launching a project.

BLOOCK collateralizes the risk of this fluctuations between all the integrated customers and partners and accepts payments in FIAT to wipe off the map the major concerns of any SMB joining the crypto space.

### Interoperability

BLOOCK records your fingerprints to multiple distributed ledgers de-risking you from protocol failures and easing stakeholder interactions

Why:

- In order to benefit from a distributed system, the establishment of industrywide collaboration and common standards for interoperability is critical, enhancing cross-industry applications.
- Interoperability helps connecting multiple stakeholders through multiple blockchains, especially for industries that needs a smooth collaboration between DLT and the existing high volume of legacy systems.
- With cross-chain transaction, users can benefit from multiple auditors and trusted protocol on all networks.

BLOOCK sends its packages to multiple distributed ledgers such as Ethereum, XDAI, Polygon, etc. hence protecting from network failures and enabling multiple entities to work cooperatively in different protocols.

### Technologically independent

BLOOCK provides a no-trust service for you can be completely autonomous from our service status.

Why:

- In software, resilience is a very important aspect, specifically in critical processes. One of the most difficult parts to control are external services.
- There are multiple situations where a service provider can get its service degraded: software issue, infrastructure availability, communications issue, etc.
- With a provider availability alternative, you can fully control those situations, allowing your service to remain unaffected.

BLOOCK lets you download atemporal proofs of existence for future usage, not depending on our service to allow verification.
