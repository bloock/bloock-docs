# Event types

:::tip
It is important to note that you can configure as many events as you wish in the same webhook endpoint.

### Digital notaritzation

#### Record entity

1. **Ethereum Mainnet**: you will receive every time your record it's transacted and confirmed on Ethereum.
2. **Gnosis Chain**: you will receive every time your record it's transacted and confirmed on Gnosis Chain.
3. **Polygon PoS**: you will receive every time your record it's transacted and confirmed on Polygon PoS.

**Body**:

2. **Gnosis Chain**: you will receive every time an anchor it's transacted and confirmed on Gnosis Chain.
3. **Polygon PoS**: you will receive every time an anchor it's transacted and confirmed on Polygon PoS.

Here you have some differences between the record and anchor events:

| Aspect                    | Anchor Webhook Event                                                                | Record Webhook Event                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Event Triggered           | Triggered when an anchor is transacted on the selected network.                     | Triggered when a record is transacted and confirmed on the network.                  |
| Frequency of Events       | Occurs with every anchor transacted on the selected network.                        | Occurs with your records transacted and confirmed.                                   |
| Information Received      | Provides information about the anchor and networks.                                 | Provides information about the record transaction and networks.                      |
| Use Case                  | Useful for tracking the status of anchor transactions.                              | Useful for tracking the status of record transactions.                               |
| Verification Process      | Requires comparison between sent and received anchors to verify transaction status. | No additional comparison needed, as it directly indicates record transaction status. |
| Implementation Complexity | May require additional logic for comparing anchors.                                 | Straightforward, as it directly indicates record transaction status.                 |

### Identity

1. **SMTP proof**: you will receive every time your issuer state is transacted on Polygon PoS.
