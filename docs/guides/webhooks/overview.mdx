# Receive BLOOCK events

Listen for events on your BLOOCK integration so you can automatically trigger reactions.

First, we should understand what is a webhook. A webhook is an HTTP request, triggered by an event in the source system and then, sent to the destination system. Webhooks are automatically sent out when their event is fired in the source system.

BLOOCK uses webhooks to notify your application when an event occurs in the source system. Webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events such as when we want to wait for a record to be confirmed. When users submit a record to BLOOCK, internally, it is processed and included in an anchor. Normally, once a user submits their record to the blockchain, they will go through a long process of polling, or waiting for anchor confirmation before they know if their record was successfully submitted. To avoid this problem, users can now subscribe to our events and provide us with the URL they want to be notified.
