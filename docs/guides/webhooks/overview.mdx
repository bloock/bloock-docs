# Overview

Welcome to our Webhooks functionality, designed to empower your BLOOCK integration with automated reactions triggered by events. Here's a comprehensive overview of how Webhooks work and the benefits they bring to your application:

### What is a Webhook?

A webhook is an HTTP request triggered by an event in the source system and sent to the destination system.
When an event occurs in the source system, such as submitting a record to BLOOCK, a webhook is automatically sent out to notify the destination system.

### Utilizing Webhooks in BLOOCK:

BLOOCK leverages webhooks to notify your application when events occur in the source system.
Webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events, like waiting for a record to be confirmed on the blockchain.

By using this feature you will obtain:

- Automation: Automate reactions in your application based on events occurring in BLOOCK.
- Real-time Notifications: Receive instant notifications about important events, such as record submissions and confirmations.
- Efficiency: Streamline processes by eliminating the need for manual confirmation checks and reducing waiting times.

### How to Get Started:

- Subscribe to BLOOCK's events and provide your notification URL to start receiving webhook notifications.
- Seamlessly integrate BLOOCK's Webhooks functionality into your application to automate reactions and enhance efficiency.
