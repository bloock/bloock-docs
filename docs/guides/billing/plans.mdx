#### What are the records, requests, hosting and download values?

Are what we call plan-included usage. They are the amount you can use for each of the BLOOCK products for which you will not be charged extra. If you exceed these limits, then this is what we call overage.
In all BLOOCK plans, you have a plan-included usage for each of our main products (Decentralized Timestamping, Digital Identity, Managed Keys, Decentralized Storage) and Infrastructure cost. The Basic plan is the plan that includes the least usage of the products, while the Production plan includes the most usage.
The usage limits included in the monthly plans are renewed every month. While those belonging to annual plans are renewed every year.
