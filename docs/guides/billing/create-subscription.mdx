You can enjoy your trial plan by clicking on Use the free version. In this case your actions will be limited but you will be able to start using some of our products in a test environment. For example, you will be able to certify your messages using a test Api Key.

In the free plan the blockchain is an internal testing server that will act as a blockchain repository.
