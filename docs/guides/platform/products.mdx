**Access Control**

BLOOCK allows adding access controls to manage keys and certificates. To learn more about how access controls work, [please refer to this section](https://docs.bloock.com/guides/products/key/concepts/access-control/#secret-based-authentication).

**_Add Access Control_**

You can add an access control both at the time of key and certificate creation and through the "Key Details" section.

**Key and certificate creation form:**

At the bottom of the creation form, there are different access control options. Currently, options include Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) or Secret-based Authentication:

![enter image description here](https://cdn.bloock.com/hosting/v1/hosted/056b9616-beb8-40e0-93dd-68ce5a67f6d2)

- **Using TOTP:**

When selecting the TOTP option and confirming the creation process, a window will appear providing information for adding access control:

![enter image description here](https://cdn.bloock.com/hosting/v1/hosted/161a88c2-08c2-490a-b316-69260e509b03)

To utilize this functionality, you can use apps and browser extensions like 1Password, Google Authenticator, and Microsoft Authenticator, which generate one-time passwords used as a second factor to verify your access to this key.

Scan the generated QR code using any of the mentioned applications or manually enter the code provided at the bottom. Additionally, there are recovery codes in case the user loses access to the key.

![enter image description here](https://cdn.bloock.com/hosting/v1/hosted/c0919a85-55a0-493f-83c7-516739f1a48e)

> Note: It's important to save these recovery codes as BLOOCK does not store this information.

- **Secret-based Authentication:**

When selecting the Secret-based option, a form will appear with a secret field, which should be the code used for any operation with the access key and a field for a recovery email to retrieve the key if the user loses access to it.

![enter image description here](https://cdn.bloock.com/hosting/v1/hosted/b591ad73-4ce2-493d-b4ad-7dd4717d7c91)

**Key and certificate details section:**

- **Using TOTP:**

When selecting the TOTP option and confirming by clicking the "Next" button, information for operating with the key via access control will appear:

To utilize this functionality, you can use apps and browser extensions like 1Password, Google Authenticator, and Microsoft Authenticator, which generate one-time passwords that are used as a second factor to verify your access to this key.

Scan the generated QR code using any of the mentioned applications or manually enter the code provided at the bottom. Additionally, there are recovery codes in case the user loses access to the key.

![enter image description here](https://cdn.bloock.com/hosting/v1/hosted/140828c4-a291-4022-bc29-e5b49eb12b58)

**_Edit Access Control_**

If you wish to edit the access control of the key, select the "Edit Access Control" option from the dropdown menu on the key or certificate details screen. To proceed with the process, you will need to enter the "Secret" of the key if it is of the secret-based type.
