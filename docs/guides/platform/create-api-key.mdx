In order to connect to our services you need an API key. To create a new API Key, you can access the [API Keys](/guides/platform/developers/#api-keys) section in our Dashboard.

To create an API key you have to set:

- A name
- An expiration date
- The scopes

Once created you'll need to save the token because, for security reasons, BLOOCK doesn't store the keys.
