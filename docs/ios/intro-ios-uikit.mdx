Dyte's iOS UI Kit is a prebuilt design library of UI components that makes it easy to integrate video and voice calls into any iOS app within minutes.

## The Anatomy of iOS UI Kit

The UI Kit is a design library of prebuilt UI components built on top of the [iOS Core SDK](/iOS-core). Core SDK handles all the low-level complexities such as media and network handling parts of a meeting and exposes easy-to-use developer friendly APIs. The idea is to make pass a iOS meeting client to a component that you want to change as per your design.

Uses a layered design structure, allowing you to start with one prebuilt component and slowly add further layers as the needs evolve. For example, you can create a full fledged meeting experience using just one UI component, `DyteUIKit`. The `DyteUIKit` component contains all the necessary features and subcomponents to create a default meeting UI.

## How to use iOS UI Kit?

Dyte's UI Kit offers a couple of ways to get started with your live video and voice calling applications:

- **Use prebuilt components**: You can use prebuilt `DyteUIKit` component to create your meeting quickly. With this component, you don't have to handle all the states, dialogs, and other aspects of managing the application. The UI kit also respect your permissions and theming configuration from the preset.

  For more information, see [iOS UI Kit Quickstart](/iOS/quickstart).

- **Build UI as per your theme**: Dyte also offers the flexibility to implement your in-house themes to Dyte UI kit. This offers a customization option to improve user experience on your app.
